# Task 21
# Define a variable called number1 and give it a value of 1
# Define another variable called number2 and give it a value of 1
# What is the type of the variable number1 and number2?
# Compare if both the values inside the variables are equal using the == operator
# Store/assign the result of comparison into another variable called result
# Display the result variable as an output using the print() function
 
# Expected output:
# The output should be True

# Check the type of number1 and number2
type_number1 = type(number1)

# Compare if both values inside the variables are equal
result = number1 == number2
