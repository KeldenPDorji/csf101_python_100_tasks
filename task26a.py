# Task 26a
# Define a variable called variable1 and give it a value of True
# Define another variable called variable2 and give it a value of False
# Define another variable called variable3 and give it a value of False
# Define another variable called variable4 and give it a value of False
# Compare the variables using “or” operator:
# Store/assign the result of comparison into another variable called result
# 	result = variable1 or variable2 or variable3 or variable4
# Display the result variable as an output using the print() function
 
# Expected output:
# The output should be True:
# Can you guess why?
