# Conditionals
# For conditionals, it is important to know about comparison operators and boolean.
# Boolean: either true or false

# Task 20
# Define a variable called number1 and give it a value of 1
# Define another variable called number2 and give it a value of 2
# Compare if both the values inside the variables are equal using the == operator
# Store/assign the result of comparison into another variable called result
# Display the result variable as an output using the print() function
 
# Expected output:
# The output should be False

number1 = 1
number2 = 2
result = number1 == number2
print(result)
