# Task 26b
# (same as task 25 but using and operator)
# Define a variable called variable1 and give it a value of True
# Define another variable called variable2 and give it a value of False
# Define another variable called variable3 and give it a value of False
# Define another variable called variable4 and give it a value of False
# Compare the variables using “and” operator:
# Store/assign the result of comparison into another variable called result
# 	result = variable1 and variable2 and variable3 and variable4
# Display the result variable as an output using the print() function
 
# Expected output:
# The output should be False:
# Can you guess why?

variable1 = True
variable2 = False
variable3 = False
variable4 = False

# Compare the variables using the "and" operator
result = variable1 and variable2 and variable3 and variable4
