# Task 26
# Define a variable called number1 and give it a value of “a”
# Define another variable called number2 and give it a value of “b”
# What is the type of the variable number1 and number2
# Compare if number1 is greater than number2 using “>” operator
# Store/assign the result of comparison into another variable called result
# Display the result variable as an output using the print() function
 
# Expected output:
# The output should be False:
# Can you guess why?

number1 = "a"
number2 = "b"

# Check the type of number1 and number2
type_number1 = type(number1)
type_number2 = type(number2)

# Compare if number1 is greater than number2 using the > operator
result = number1 > number2

print("Type of number1:", type_number1)
